                            “Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it.”<br/>
                            ― Terry Pratchett<br/>

                            In times of misinformation and sheer propaganda, the youth saw an opportunity to bring light in this darkness. They saw that people deserved only the truth and facts and that’s their right.<br/>

                            With the aim and vision to shine light on all that is true and to deliver truthful and factual news The Odde Tribune was born. 4 young minds, hard headed to achieve the same aim and to fight propaganda made it a reality.<br/>

                            We believe that only when the reader is given the liberty to form their own opinions with regards to any news, the job of a journalist or a media house is done, the job of the fourth pillar of the democracy is done.<br/>

                            We get to you, only facts and truth filtering out the personal bias and propaganda that floods the internet everyday.<br/>
